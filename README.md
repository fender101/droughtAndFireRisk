# Drought and Large Widfires in CA

Team project focused on reviewing California wildfire history and current drought conditions. Fire icons ![Image of fire](fire-element-sm.png) indicate where the 20 largest CA wildfires in history occurred. Size of the icon indicates the acres burned by the fires. <br>
My responsibility on this team was to help present the project and exclusively work on the drought map visualization. <br>

Tools used: Aeris json, leafletJS, MapBox, javascript, html/css. <br>
